Follow these steps to use the app correctly:

Configure the contracts to point to the specified blockchain network (Ganache)
Run Truffle migrations (truffle migrate --reset)

NOTE: You can trim the decimals of mUSDT to 18 zeros in the Tether contract. Do this while we are programming to avoid errors. This will give you a currency with fewer decimals and more visually usable.
